# golang

Go package repository to manage logs files that Jenkins generate

## What to do 
* Parse text log file and build.xml for each build 
* Insert parsed data to Mongo db 

## Why use go to analyze Jenkins logs and xml file. 
* Easy multiprocess programming with channel 
* Very intuitive mapping sequence between objects and XML/JSON 
** No redundant codes to write a default value for each mapped field
